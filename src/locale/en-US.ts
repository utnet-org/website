It is different from the traditional Proof of computational power based on Proof of Work (PoW), which requires consuming computational resources by solving complex mathematical problems. Instead, POCI relies on random numbers and power competition on the chain to elect suitable miners to generate new blocks.",

Through on-chain random numbers and computing power competition, POCI fairly elects the right miners to generate new blocks, which not only ensures the efficient use of computing power, but also protects the network from malicious behavior. In addition, POCI enables the UtilityNet network to avoid a large number of ineffective calculations that are often used in traditional blockchains to combat the Byzantine checkmate problem. This increase in efficiency allows 99% of computing power to be freed up for more practical services, such as distributed training and inference computing, enabling large-scale applications.",
